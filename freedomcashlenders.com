Traditional banks, credit unions, online-only lenders and peer-to-peer lenders offer personal loans. If your credit is not great or you are trying to establish credit, it might be easier to qualify for a loan at a credit union, but there are online lenders that work with borrowers with less-than-stellar credit.

Depending on the lender or institution, the application and approval process for personal loans is often immediate and you'll get the funds disbursed in a lump sum amount within one to two business days.

Personal loans are unsecured, so your credit score carries a lot of weight in lending decisions. Borrowers with good to excellent credit get the best rates and terms. That being said, before you start applying get a copy of your credit report and check it for incorrect or outdated information and make sure you meet the lender's minimum credit requirements.
