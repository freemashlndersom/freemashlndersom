Start by entering how much you want to borrow in the field marked Loan Info. Then use the personal loan calculator to:

    Simulate your payback period in years or months.
    Calculate the ideal interest rate on your loan.
    See how much you would pay in principal and interest.

You can select "show" to see a timetable of how your monthly payments of principal and interest will reduce your balance until your loan is repaid. Use the "add extra payments" feature to find out how paying more toward your principal speeds up your amortization schedule.
