Once you’ve priced out scenarios with the personal loan calculator, compare the best personal loan offers from Bankrate’s lending partners to find the interest rate and terms that best fit your budget and goals.

Consider the pros and cons of taking out a personal loan before making a final decision. While personal loans are versatile, there are alternatives to personal loans that may come with lower interest and fees, especially if your credit is less-than-stellar.

Before choosing a lender, compare the interest rates, terms and features that each lender offers. Many lenders give you the option to prequalify, which allows you to see the predicted rates you could qualify for without impacting your credit. Only apply once you've found the lender that offers the most competitive rates and terms for your credit situation.
